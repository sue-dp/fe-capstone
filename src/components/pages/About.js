        This capstone project has pushed me to relearn concepts we learned in
        class and learn new concepts. Asking lots of questions has been vital.
        Asking the right questions has been even more important.

        When the capstone project was presented, it was overwhelming and
        daunting. Following advice from my instructor, I broke the project down
        into pieces and used the wireframe I created to help me visualize the
        flow of the app. This step was crucial as the app grew page by page. I
        began with the Contact Us page because I knew that I would be able to
        create this page without too many issues. Asking questions and doing
        research on toast notifications and setting state on this page proved
        helpful as I moved deeper into the other pages and components. Finishing
        this page and having it working correctly was a moral booster that gave
        me more confidence to move on. Building out the Products page and the
        Shopping Cart page were two very different experiences. The Products
        page came together quickly and linking each product to its own page
        worked well. Even adding the product to the Shopping Cart worked
        smoothly. However, the Shopping Cart page was a different story. NaN
        errors abounded and the subtotal, shipping, and grand totals proved
        exceptionally difficult to navigate. After asking for help and listening
        carefully to new logic and structure ideas, it was evident that some
        refactoring was needed. The biggest issue was that I had created a piece
        of State and a key:value pair in my product object that were the same.
        Once I decided to just work with one of these (the key:value pair), it
        was gratifying to see all the functionality working after the refactor.
        In essence, the mathematical logic and flow were correct, but the data
        was mixed up and confused (or rather, I was confused and mixed up all
        the data!) Styling the mobile styles was challenging and required a lot
        of trial and error.

        This course is one of the hardest things I have attempted and completed
        in my life. The challenges of balancing home life, work, class, and
        homework have stretched me to find creative ways to accomplish
        everything. I have learned to prioritize and focus on what is most
        important in each area. Some of the greatest challenges in this class
        have been asynchronous JavaScript (JS) and writing functions in JS.
        Spending time re-watching the class videos, going through documentation,
        and asking questions helped me get a better handle on those concepts. At
        times, the self-doubt and continual failures to write working code were
        completely overwhelming and many tears were shed in frustration and
        deflation. However, after the deluge of tears and some bad words, I
        remembered to “Own My Journey” and I got up and wrote one piece of code
        that worked and used that momentum to keep looking for answers. I am
        also blessed to be part of an extremely supportive and encouraging
        cohort. The hints and tips from my fellow cohorts have been a large part
        of my learning and growing. These young men are inspiring, and their
        grit and determination are exemplary – I love being able to work and
        learn with them.

        I have learned so many new things in this course and it has been very
        challenging, yet incredibly fulfilling. I enjoy working in HTML and SCSS
        – The structuring and nesting of these 2 languages make sense to me and
        I enjoy watching the styles come to life. JavaScript was difficult and
        lots of devs told me not to worry, that React would make it much easier.
        I did not find that to be the case. Learning React was difficult and
        confusing for me in the beginning. However, after completing this
        capstone and spending hours and hours working in React, creating and
        building the vision that I had for my app, it has become my favorite
        language. The foundation built in HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript has
        made React an incredible tool to use. Without that foundation this would
        not be the case for me. The DevPipeline model of building a foundation
        and then using new tools and knowledge to keep building has been an
        excellent way for me to learn. Who knew that at almost 50 years old, I
        could learn so much and do so many new things. Challenging: Absolutely,
        Worth It: 100%.
